Tidyverse package loaded at the start of this notebook, as it is a convenient package that includes tidyr, ggplot2, dplyramong other useful packages.

```{r setup}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
library(scales) #for the percentage function below
```

**Load in the summary sequencing file for the extraction method/barcode being examined**

```{r}
sequencing_summary <- read_delim ("C:/Users/keegk/OneDrive - moredungroup/Karen Keegan/Nanopore/SQKRBK004/Extraction_experiment_run_22.2.23/Rebasecalling/Rebasecalled_trimmed_super_accuracy/barcode_2/sequencing_summary_barcode2.txt")

                      filter(!barcode_arrangement == "barcode02") %>%
                      select(read_id) #this is isolating the reads that are on the wrong barcode, so I can use this read Id list to remove these reads in the blast text files (blast text files are assigned taxonomy in the notebook "taxonomizr_blast_tidied_2025.Rmd")

extexp2025_barcode2_remove_reads <- save(extexp2025_barcode2_remove_reads, file = "extexp2025_barcode2_remove_reads")
load("extexp2025_barcode2_remove_reads") #this was saved with 2025 written after it but the actual file name loads in without the 2025 bit after it just FYI.


sequencing_summary <- sequencing_summary %>%
                      filter(barcode_arrangement == "barcode02") #making sure only the correct barcode is included
