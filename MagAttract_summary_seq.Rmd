Tidyverse package loaded at the start of this notebook, as it is a convenient package that includes tidyr, ggplot2, dplyramong other useful packages.

```{r set up}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```


**Load in the summary sequencing file for the extraction method/barcode being examined**


```{r}
sequencing_summary <- read_delim ("C:/Users/keegk/OneDrive - moredungroup/Karen Keegan/Nanopore/SQKRBK004/Extraction_experiment_run_22.2.23/Rebasecalling/Rebasecalled_trimmed_super_accuracy/barcode_6/sequencing_summary.txt")

sequencing_summary <- sequencing_summary %>%
                      filter(barcode_full_arrangement == "RBK406") #making sure only the correct barcode is included
```

**Read QC from the summary sequencing file**

#Percentage <- format(round(percentage, 2)) # percentage of reads that passed
